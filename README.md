# gae-go-testing ⚠️ archived

> ⚠️ This repository is no longer maintained and is archived. The Go ecosystem has evolved a lot with regards to how it uses Context, and the App Engine service has also changed a lot in the meantime. It is unlikely that this library would still work today.

Testing library for Go App Engine, giving you an appengine.Context fake that forwards to a dev_appserver.py child process.
This library is fixed for go1 based on http://code.google.com/p/gae-go-testing/ .
This library works on GAE/G 1.7.0 or higher and go1 and tested on:

    * GAE/G 1.7.0, go 1.0.2
    * GAE/G 1.7.1, go 1.0.2
